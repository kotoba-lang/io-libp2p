  "The `/pk/` validator, on both runtimes.

  `store_test.clj` covers more and is `.clj`, which is how this namespace came
  to do both wrong things at once under ClojureScript: `(mapv int \"/pk/\")` is
  four zeroes there, so a real public-key record was rejected and any key
  beginning with four zero bytes was accepted as one. A validator that fails
  open is worse than no validator, and this file exists so that claim is
  checked where it was false."
