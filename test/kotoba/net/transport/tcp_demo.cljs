;; Not a unit test -- an EXECUTABLE end-to-end demo that must genuinely
;; pass when run. It proves kotoba.net.transport.tcp actually moves
;; gossip/bitswap protocol messages between real peers over real TCP
;; sockets, built on kotoba-lang/wire. Run from this repo's root:
;;
;;   nbb --classpath "src:test:../wire/src:../bytes/src" \
;;     test/kotoba/net/transport/tcp_demo.cljs
;;
;; (relative --classpath entries mean this must run with cwd at this
;; repo's root, with kotoba-lang/wire and kotoba-lang/bytes checked out as
;; siblings -- same layout deps.edn assumes. Scenario 1 also `spawn`s two
;; real, separate `nbb` OS processes, found via $PATH, running
;; bin/net_node.cljs with the same --classpath.)
;;
;; Scenario 1 proves real multi-node gossip fanout AND dedup together, in
;; a genuinely non-trivial (3-node, fully-meshed, not just A->B) topology,
;; across real separate OS processes for two of the three nodes -- the
;; strongest form available, mirroring kotoba-lang/dtn's own tcp_demo.cljs
;; scenario 1 (spawned child + grep its own stdout, not just a local
;; return value).
;;
;; Scenarios 2 and 3 run in-process (multiple real node handles, real
;; sockets, same OS process) -- sufficient to prove bitswap want/have and
;; delta-sync round-trip over the wire without the extra weight of a
;; second spawned process for every scenario.
;;
;; Prints PASS/FAIL per scenario, a final "RESULT: N/3 scenarios passed"
;; line, and exits 0 iff all 3 passed (else 1).
