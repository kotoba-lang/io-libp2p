(ns kotoba.net.transport.tcp
  "The real network-I/O adapter kotoba-net's own README explicitly
  deferred (\"Any real network I/O ... left to a future native adapter\"):
  a 'gossip node' that actually moves kotoba.net.gossip /
  kotoba.net.bitswap protocol messages between real peers over real TCP
  sockets. kotoba.net.gossip and kotoba.net.bitswap stay exactly what
  they always were -- pure, transport-independent decision functions --
  this namespace is a CONSUMER of them, not a modifier: every dedup /
  fanout / want-have / delta-sync decision below is made by calling
  straight into gossip/route-message, bitswap/respond-to-want, or
  bitswap/commits-since unchanged, then this namespace's only job is
  actually delivering the result over a socket.

  .cljs, NOT .cljc: real `node:net` socket I/O (via kotoba.wire.tcp), so
  this only runs under a Node-hosted ClojureScript runtime (nbb in this
  repo). The JVM `clojure -M:test` suite never loads `.cljs` files, so
  this namespace can never regress kotoba-net's existing pure `.cljc`
  test suite (see README.md for the current assertion count).

  WIRE FRAMING / SOCKET PLUMBING -- delegated entirely to
  [`kotoba-lang/wire`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/wire) (Phase 2 of a
  shared-lib consolidation across kotoba-lang protocol libraries -- Phase
  1 was `kotoba-lang/bytes`, which `kotoba-lang/wire` itself depends on;
  `kotoba-lang/dtn`'s own TCP transport was refactored onto `wire` first
  and is the pattern this namespace follows). This namespace never
  hand-rolls length-prefix framing, Buffer accumulation/defragmentation,
  or an outbound socket pool -- it calls `kotoba.wire.tcp/start-server!` /
  `connect-or-reuse!` / `send-framed!` / `close-all!` for exactly that
  mechanics, the same functions `kotoba-lang/dtn`'s transport already
  consumes (this is the second real consumer of `kotoba-lang/wire`, and
  the entire point of depending on it instead of re-implementing the same
  plumbing a third time). One narrow exception, documented in full at
  `attach-response-reader!` below: `wire.tcp/start-server!` already wires
  an inbound (server-accepted) socket to auto-decode arriving frames, but
  exposes no equivalent for a socket THIS node dialed out itself via
  `connect-or-reuse!` -- so `want!`/`request-commits-since!` need to
  receive their response back over that same outbound socket, and the
  small helper that makes that possible is built from wire's own public
  pure codec functions (`kotoba.wire.framing/defragment` +
  `kotoba.wire.edn/decode-frames` -- the exact building blocks wire.tcp's
  own PRIVATE `make-frame-reader` uses internally), not a re-implementation
  of framing.

  WHAT'S GENUINELY REAL: message delivery over real TCP sockets; gossip
  fanout forwarding that actually re-delivers to real peer sockets
  (`publish!` for locally-originated messages, and automatic re-forwarding
  of inbound messages this node hasn't already seen); bitswap want/have
  request-response over a real socket round-trip (`want!`); bitswap
  delta-sync request-response over a real socket round-trip
  (`request-commits-since!`). Every one of these is provable end-to-end
  in `test/kotoba/net/transport/tcp_demo.cljs` (real sockets between real
  node handles, at least one scenario across real separate OS processes).

  WHAT STAYS OUT OF SCOPE (same as kotoba-net's own founding README, and
  the same limitation `kotoba-lang/dtn`'s own direct transport already
  has):
    - Peer discovery / DHT -- peers are configured up front via
      start-node!'s :peers option. This node never learns about a peer it
      wasn't told about.
    - NAT traversal.
    - QUIC transport or a Noise handshake -- this is plain TCP, cleartext,
      unauthenticated at the transport level. kotoba-net's README
      describes the ORIGINAL Rust crate this library's semantics were
      extracted from as libp2p-based (QUIC + Noise + GossipSub); this
      adapter deliberately does not attempt to reconstruct that stack --
      it is the honestly-scoped 'any transport that can carry these EDN
      messages' adapter the README asked for, not a libp2p re-implementation.
    - Any authentication / encryption of the peer connection itself (contrast
      kotoba-lang/dtn's optional :peer-secrets HMAC layer -- this namespace
      has no equivalent; every configured peer is trusted as given).

  TWO REAL GAPS DISCOVERED IN kotoba.net.gossip WHILE WIRING THIS UP, NEITHER
  FIXED BY EDITING gossip.cljc (out of scope for this phase -- worked around
  entirely from this namespace instead; see README for the full writeup):

  1. `goog.crypt.Sha256` (kotoba.net.gossip/content-hash's :cljs branch) is a
     real Google Closure Library class available for free under a full
     Closure-Compiler build (shadow-cljs -- the environment gossip.cljc's own
     top-of-file comment documents it was written against) but NOT bundled by
     nbb (confirmed against a real nbb 1.4.210 install: it ships
     goog.string/goog.crypt shims but no Sha256). See
     `src/goog/crypt/Sha256.cljs` in this repo -- an nbb-classpath-only shim
     (Node's built-in `node:crypto`, the same 'no npm dep, use Node core
     crypto under nbb' pattern kotoba-lang/dtn's kotoba.dtn.auth already
     established for its own HMAC-SHA256) that supplies exactly the two
     methods gossip.cljc's content-hash calls, verified byte-for-byte against
     known SHA-256 test vectors. `clojure -M:test` and a shadow-cljs build
     are both unaffected -- this shim is never on either of those classpaths.
  2. `kotoba.net.gossip/route-message` and `gossip-fanout` build their
     internal exclude set via the LITERAL `#{from self}` syntax. Clojure's
     (and ClojureScript's, and nbb's SCI) `#{}` set-literal reader macro
     compiles to a CHECKED set constructor that throws
     `IllegalArgumentException: Duplicate key: X` whenever two elements
     evaluate to an EQUAL runtime value -- confirmed this is real, general
     Clojure behavior (not an nbb-only quirk):
     `clojure -M -e '(let [from \"a\" self \"a\"] #{from self})'` throws the
     identical error under plain JVM Clojure. A locally-originated `publish!`
     naturally has :from = :self (there is no previous hop to exclude for a
     message this node itself originates), and gossip.cljc's own
     route-message-test suite never exercises that case (its fixtures always
     use distinct :from/:self values), so this landmine was never surfaced
     until this real transport needed to actually call route-message for a
     self-originated message. See `safe-from` below for the workaround (never
     hand route-message a colliding :from/:self pair -- substitute nil,
     which never matches a real peer-id, so the fanout-exclusion semantics
     are unaffected)."

  scope, gossip.cljc's pure semantics/API are NOT modified to fix this --
  this namespace instead simply never hands route-message a colliding
  pair: substitutes nil for `from` whenever it would otherwise equal
  `self`. This is semantically correct either way, not just a crash

  A message already present in the seen-cache produces an EMPTY :forward

  peers for topic AND marks the message's content-hash seen on this
  node's own :seen-cache (so if this exact message loops back to this
  node later via gossip, it's correctly treated as an already-seen
  duplicate rather than re-published/re-forwarded). Then actually
  delivers to every fanout target over a real socket (deliver-gossip!,
  the identical delivery path handle-gossip! uses for re-forwarding an
  inbound message).

  Returns the :forward vector route-message computed (each entry
  {:to peer-id :payload payload}) -- the set of peers this call actually
  wrote to, for a caller/test that wants to confirm real fanout happened.

  :from is passed through safe-from -- for a locally-originated message
  :from and :self are ALWAYS equal (this node IS both, by construction),
  which would otherwise unconditionally crash gossip.cljc's route-message
  every single time; see safe-from's docstring."
