  "Answering, rather than only asking.

  A client dials, identifies and queries; every inbound stream it resets. That
  takes from the network without serving it, and for a DHT the asymmetry is not
  merely impolite: a node nobody can query holds no useful position in the
  keyspace, so its own lookups get worse answers than a serving peer's.

  This namespace is the protocol half of serving -- what to reply, given a
  request and a routing table. It opens no socket and holds no connection, so
  the answers are testable without a peer, which matters because the failure
  mode of a wrong answer is a peer quietly deciding you are useless rather than
  an error anyone sees."
