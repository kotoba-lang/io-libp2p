  This is the assembly point: multiaddr in, an authenticated muxed connection

  the handshake pattern, the muxer -- and none of it could reach a peer, because
  nothing opened a socket and ran them in order.

  Crypto is injected rather than chosen here. The identity key is the caller's
  (it is the peer id), and the Noise primitives come from a provider, so this
