(ns kotoba.net.libp2p.handshake
  "libp2p's identity binding on top of a Noise XX handshake.

  Noise XX authenticates two *static X25519 keys* to each other. libp2p peers
  are identified by a *different* key — usually Ed25519 — and a peer id is a
  multihash of that one. Nothing in Noise connects the two, so libp2p adds the
  connection: each side sends, inside the handshake, its identity public key and
  a signature by that identity key over

      \"noise-libp2p-static-key:\" || <its own Noise static public key>

  Without this a peer authenticates a Noise key belonging to nobody in
  particular, and the peer id it thinks it dialed is unverified. With it, a
  successful XX handshake plus a valid signature says: *the party holding this
  Noise static key is the holder of that identity key*, which is what makes the
  peer id in a multiaddr mean anything.

  The signature is over the static key, not over the transcript, and that is
  deliberate in the spec: it can be produced offline and reused across
  connections, so the identity key need not be online for every dial."
