  "A libp2p node: it dials, it listens, it answers, and it keeps a routing table.

  The difference between this and the dialer is not features but posture. A
  client asks the network for answers and gives none back; for a DHT that is
  not merely impolite, because a node nobody can reach occupies no useful
  position in the keyspace and its own lookups get worse answers than a serving
  peer's. Listening, answering `/ipfs/kad/1.0.0`, and remembering who answered
  are one change, not three.

  `kad.table` owns the routing table and its eviction rule; `kad.lookup` owns
  the iterative search. Neither is re-implemented here -- this supplies the
  socket and the loop they were written to be driven by."
