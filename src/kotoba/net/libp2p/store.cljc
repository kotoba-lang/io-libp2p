  "What a DHT node keeps for other people.

  Two stores with different rules, and the difference is the whole design.

  A **record** is a value someone asked us to hold under a key. Holding one is
  a claim that anybody who asks us for that key gets a correct answer, so a
  node that accepts records it cannot check is worse than one that accepts
  none: it becomes a confident source of whatever it was handed. Validation is
  therefore **injected and deny-by-default** -- the DHT has no universal notion
  of a valid record, only per-namespace rules (`/ipns/…` is a signed record,
  `/pk/…` is a key that must hash to its own key), and a store that guessed
  would be guessing about correctness.

  A **provider** is a claim that a peer has a block. Nobody can verify that
  from here and it is not supposed to be verifiable -- the claim is checked by
  going and asking. What matters instead is that it EXPIRES: a provider record
  that outlives the peer's interest sends every future requester to a node that
  no longer has the block, and the network's answer quality degrades quietly.

  Both are bounded. An unbounded store is a memory-exhaustion vector reachable
  by anyone who can send us a message.")
